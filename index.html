     <p>
       I am a programmer........a computer engineering student, a music lover who learned first violin and then switched to sitar, animal and bird lover who is trying to merge all of his passions into one project, so that I can stop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List">IUCN RED List</a> from growing and make sure that my field does not steal jobs from people but give them a new one, a new opportunity so that...........

     <p class=" ">
      Well not much. I try to become a better person each day and am trying to understand the concept of acceptance in my work and personal life. Whether it is my doubts about my carrier or which Raga I will play today on my Sitar. I have my other portfolio which is somewhat Professionalish, here is the link: <a href="http://www.narenbakshi.me">My Work Portfolio site <small>(Not updated)</small></a>. For this site I am kind of in a philosophical and blogger mood.

       <strong>I live there......the blue struggling planet which is tired of its habitants.</strong><p id="where">
       I live very near to a very beautiful sea beach, a dense forest full of Macaws and exotic species, a mountain that is the largest in the world with full of snow and adventures, a vast desert and a big canyon. The first is 400km away, second is 6927km away, third is 1367km, fourth one is 4170km and the last is 13712km.......... well 8521 miles away from my home. Now I bet you that you can track me easily with such famous spots mentioned here.
       PS: These places are on Earth.
